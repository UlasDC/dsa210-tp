#  DSA 210 – Term Project: The Impact of Phone Usage Patterns on Sleep and Productivity

##  Motivation  
This project analyzes how **daily smartphone usage** impacts **sleep duration and productivity**. The goal is to determine whether excessive phone usage reduces sleep quality and work efficiency. If so, I will adjust my habits to achieve **a more balanced phone usage routine**.  

##  Dataset & Sources  
- **Date Tracking:** As the project aims a daily usage traction, i will record every data daily. To get the date, i will simply use a calendar.  
- **Screen Time, Notifications and Pickups:** These data will be the main columns of my project as it will demonstrate my daily smartphone usage. These data will be collected using Apple’s **“App & Website Activity”** feature.  
- **Sleep Data:** My daily sleep data will be collected using  **Apple Health (Sleep Tracker)**.  
- **Productivity:** I will set a minimum work time (4 hours) for every day and will collect my actual work time (excluded the time i spend on my phone, coffee breaks etc.) and using these data i will represent productivity as a percentage. 

**After the data collection, i will apply  these steps for data clarification:**

##  Data Processing & Cleaning  
- **Time Alignment:** Will synchronize timestamps for phone usage, sleep logs, and productivity data..  
- **Categorization:** Will group apps into **School (Work), Social Media, Messaging**.  
- **Outlier Removal:** Will exclude extreme data like unusually short or long sleep/work durations.  

##  Analysis & Methodology  
- **Data Collection Period:** March 15 – April 15 (Starting approximately **4 weeks** before last midterm)  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Will identify the patterns, trends and relationships between the data using statistical methods and visualization techniques.
- **Statistical Methods & Models:**  
  - **Correlation Analysis:** Measure the relationship between phone usage and productivity/sleep.  
  - **Regression Models:** Predict productivity based on screen time and notifications.  

##  Expected Findings & Limitations  
With this project, i expect to see the **harmful effect** on my sleep and productivity, and by finding the **optimal usage duration**; i plan to attain a **impeccable** daily smartphone usage. However, the project is using **subjective** and self-reported data, which may cause the optimal duration to be a **personal asset** rather than an **universally solid** outcome.

##  Conclusion  
By analyzing the correlation between screen time, notifications, and pickups with sleep duration and work efficiency, I hope to determine the **optimal smartphone usage balance**. If excessive phone use is proven to negatively affect my sleep and productivity, I will make data-driven adjustments to improve my daily habits. While the findings will be **personalized**, they can serve as a **blueprint for better phone usage management**.
